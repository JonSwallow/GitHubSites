          <p> With every alleged ethics violation, with every brazen lie, with every deranged tweet, this
              administration leaves the public sphere more broken and degraded. Even if corruption (or treason)
              ultimately costs Trump the White House, what will be left behind will be wreckage—proof of the
              fundamental premise of Trump’s political project: that government is not just a swamp, it’s a burden.
              That there is nothing worth protecting. That private is better than public. And if that’s all true,
              why not wreck the place before you leave—figuratively if not literally. It’s a reminder that Trump’s
              political career would have been impossible without the degradation of the whole idea of the public sphere,
              which has been unfolding over decades.</p>
              <p> It could never have happened without the idea that “government is not
              the solution, it is the problem,” as Ronald Reagan famously put it. And it could never have happened had that
              message not been followed up with decades of deregulation that essentially legalized bribery, with outrageous
              sums of corporate money flowing into politics. It’s absolutely true that the system is corrupt. It is a swamp.
              And people know it. They know that the rewriting of the rules in favor of a small group of corporate interests
              and the one percent has been a bipartisan process—that it was Bill Clinton who deregulated the banks,
              setting the stage for the 2008 collapse, and it was Obama who chose not to prosecute the bankers, and that the Democratic
              candidate running against Trump would almost surely have done no different.</p>
