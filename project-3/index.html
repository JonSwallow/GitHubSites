            <div class="paragraph-1">
              <p>I became interested in this book when; in an interview the author Naomi Klein
              describes Donald Trump as being a symptom of the existing system at the time.
              This piqued my interest as I have held that his electoral win was the equal,
              and opposite reaction to a system in chaos. It is obvious that many can easily strongly
              dislike a figure such as Trump, who appears to possess seemingly little, or no reedeeming
              qualities whatsoever.</p>
              <p>I find Klein's views useful. She seeks not to blame or create a scapegoat, but rather
              admits where we went wrong as a country and attempts to implement a positive solution.
              She addresses the
              <!-- Strong text to enhance asthetics of the page I hope at any rate-->
              <strong>wholesale corporate fleecing</strong> of the nation, which is something that
              <!-- Emboldened and declaring strong color Id for CSS identification -->
              <em id="strong-color"> both</em> political parties can take equal credit for. This book is an
              eye opener, not in the subjects contained therein; but rather, the open discussion of those subjects. Subjects
              that should by all rights be common knowledge amongst most Americans at this point in time. </p>
